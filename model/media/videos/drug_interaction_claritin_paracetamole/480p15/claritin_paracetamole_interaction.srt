00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Let's explore the interaction between Claritin

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,220
and Paracetamol, two commonly used medications.

3
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:11,921
Claritin is an antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms

4
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:15,350
such as sneezing, runny nose and itchy eyes.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,468
Paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic, used to

6
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:23,076
treat mild to moderate pain and reduce fever.

7
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:26,793
Generally, it's considered safe to take Claritin

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,554
and Paracetamol together. However, high doses of

9
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:34,001
Paracetamol might lead to rare liver issues.

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:39,490
Follow the recommended dosages for both medications, consult a doctor

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,454
if you have any concerns, and avoid excessive Paracetamol use.

12
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,531
Always consult your doctor or

13
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,641
pharmacist for personalized medical advice.
